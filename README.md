# Unfinished-python-game
This is a fun python project that i worked on for a bit, never finished it feel free to use it if you want.
Make sure you de-compress the music track anette.zip to a .wav or the file will be incorectly called.
BEWARE , there may be some debugging needed, this was left off in a bad state i hope to fix it and make some documentation... soon lol.
